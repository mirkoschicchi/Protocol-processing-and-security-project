name: Static routing scenario
description: A simple scenario with static routing between two networks, good for testing IP and TCP implementations.
networks:
  - name: net1
    address: "2001:1::0/64"
    servers:
      - hostname: server1
        address: "2001:1::2"
  - name: net2 # first tier 2 ISP
    address: "2001:2::0/64"
    clients:
      - hostname: client1
        address: "2001:2::2"
routers:
  - hostname: r1
    interfaces:
      - network: net1
        address: "2001:1::1"
      - network: net2
        address: "2001:2::1"
    staticRoutes: ['net1', 'net2']
